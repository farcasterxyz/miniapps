# Why Farcaster Doesn't Need OAuth 2.0

OAuth exists to let three separate parties (user → platform → third-party app) establish mutual trust. Farcaster is built on a decentralized architecture
that collapses this triangle:

## 1. Identity & Authentication

* **User-owned keys:** A user controlled crypotgraphic signature proves control of a Farcaster ID—no intermediary.
* **Dev mappings** 
  - Sign In with X → Sign-in with Farcaster (SIWF) 
  - OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow → Quick Auth

## 2. Data Access & Permissions

* **Open, replicated data:** Social data like casts, reactions, and profiles live on Snapchain and can be read by anyone.
* **No permission scopes:** Everything is already public; you filter what you need instead of requesting scopes.
* **Zero-cost reads:** Sync the chain yourself or hit a public indexer—no rate caps, no $5k +/month fire-hoses.
* **Cryptographic writes:** Users can delegate a key to applications so the applications can writes on their behalf.
* **Dev mappings** 
  - Centralized APIs → Snapchain + infra services (e.g. Neynar)
  - Access token → no equivalent, data is public
  - Write permissions → App Keys

## Builder Takeaways

1. **Skip OAuth flows—wallet signature = auth.**
2. **Forget permission scopes—use filters.**
4. **Enjoy building permissionlessly**
