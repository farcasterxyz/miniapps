# Manifest

Mini Apps can publish metadata that allows Farcaster clients to more deeply
integrate with their Mini App. This file is published at
`/.well-known/farcaster.json` and the [Fully Qualified Domain
Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) where it is
hosted uniquely identifies the Mini App. The Manifest contains data that allows
Farcaster clients to verify the author of the app, present the Mini App in
discovery surfaces like app stores, and allows the Mini App to send
notifications.

Universal Links give you a single URL that can be shared outside Farcaster in
other social feeds and website that will bring users to your Mini App.

`https://farcaster.xyz/miniapps/<app-id>/<app-slug>(/<sub-path>)(?<query-params>)`

- The `<app-id>` is a unique identifier assigned to the Mini App when it is [published](/docs/guides/publishing).
- The `<app-slug>` is a kebab-case version of the Mini App name, used to create a more readable URL.
- The `<sub-path>` is an optional path appended to the Mini Appâ€™s `homeURL` when it is opened.
- The `<query-params>` are optional parameters added to the `homeURL` as a query string when the Mini App is opened.

The `<sub-path>` and `<query-params>` are optional and can be used to navigate to a specific page in the Mini App or pass data to the Mini App.

When a user clicks a Universal Link and is logged in:
- **On web**: the Mini App opens in the mini app drawer.
- **On mobile**: the browser deep links to the Farcaster app and opens the Mini App.
