# Compatibility

The goal for mini apps to build once, ship everywhere.

This guide tracks known incompatibilities as we work towards that goal.

## Base App

Below is a list of the main incompatibilities Base App is actively working on fixing. For more information on how mini apps work in Base App, please refer to [these docs](https://docs.base.org/mini-apps).

- `sdk.actions.addMiniApp` (ETA early October, more info soon!)
- `sdk.experimental.signManifest` (ETA early October, more info soon!)
