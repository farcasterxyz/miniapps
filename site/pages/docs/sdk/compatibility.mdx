# Compatibility

The goal for mini apps to build once, ship everywhere.

This guide tracks known incompatibilities as we work towards that goal.

## Base App

Below is a list of the main incompatibilities Base App is actively working on fixing. For more information on how mini apps work in Base App, please refer to [these docs](https://docs.base.org/base-app/introduction/mini-apps).

- `sdk.actions.addMiniApp()` (ETA 1-2 weeks)
- `sdk.back` methods (ETA 1-2 weeks)
- `sdk.actions.composeCast()` bug fixes for mentions and return data (ETA 1-2 weeks)
- `sdk.haptics` methods (ETA 1-2 weeks)
