# Context

When your app is opened it can access information about the session from
`sdk.context`. This object provides basic information about the user, the
client, and where your app was opened from:


```ts
export type FrameContext = {
  user: {
    fid: number;
    username?: string;
    displayName?: string;
    pfpUrl?: string;
  };
  location?: FrameLocationContext;
  client: {
    clientFid: number;
    added: boolean;
    safeAreaInsets?: SafeAreaInsets;
    notificationDetails?: FrameNotificationDetails;
  };
};
```

## Properties

### `location`

Contains information about the context from which the Mini App was launched.

```ts
export type MiniappUser = {
  fid: number;
  username?: string;
  displayName?: string;
  pfpUrl?: string;
};

export type MiniappCast = {
  author: MiniappUser;
  hash: string;
  parentHash?: string;
  parentFid?: number;
  timestamp?: number;
  mentions?: MiniappUser[];
  text: string;
  embeds?: string[];
  channelKey?: string;
};

export type CastEmbedLocationContext = {
  type: 'cast_embed';
  embed: string;
  cast: MiniappCast;
};

export type CastShareLocationContext = {
  type: 'cast_share';
  cast: MiniappCast;
};

export type NotificationLocationContext = {
  type: 'notification';
  notification: {
    notificationId: string;
    title: string;
    body: string;
  };
};

export type LauncherLocationContext = {
  type: 'launcher';
};

export type ChannelLocationContext = {
  type: 'channel';
  channel: {
    /**
     * Channel key identifier
     */
    key: string;

    /**
     * Channel name
     */
    name: string;

    /**
     * Channel profile image URL
     */
    imageUrl?: string;
  };
};

export type LocationContext =
  | CastEmbedLocationContext
  | CastShareLocationContext
  | NotificationLocationContext
  | LauncherLocationContext
  | ChannelLocationContext;
```

#### Cast Embed

Indicates that the Mini App was launched from a cast (where it is an embed).

```ts
> sdk.context.location
{
  type: "cast_embed",
  embed: "https://myapp.example.com",
  cast: {
    author: {
      fid: 3621,
      username: "alice",
      displayName: "Alice",
      pfpUrl: "https://example.com/alice.jpg"
    },
    hash: "0xa2fbef8c8e4d00d8f84ff45f9763b8bae2c5c544",
    timestamp: 1749160866000,
    mentions: [],
    text: "Check out this awesome mini app!",
    embeds: ["https://myapp.example.com"],
    channelKey: "farcaster"
  }
}
```

#### Cast Share

Indicates that the Mini App was launched when a user shared a cast to your app (similar to sharing content to an app on mobile platforms).

```ts
> sdk.context.location
{
  type: "cast_share",
  cast: {
    author: {
      fid: 12152,
      username: "pirosb3",
      displayName: "Daniel - Bountycaster",
      pfpUrl: "https://imagedelivery.net/BXluQx4ige9GuW0Ia56BHw/7229dfa5-4873-42d0-9dd0-69f4f3fc4d00/original"
    },
    hash: "0x1177603a7464a372fc358a7eabdeb70880d81612",
    timestamp: 1749160866000,
    mentions: [],
    text: "Sharing this interesting cast with you!",
    embeds: ["https://frames-v2.vercel.app/"],
    channelKey: "staging"
  }
}
```

#### Notification

Indicates that the Mini App was launched from a notification triggered by the frame.

```ts
> sdk.context.location
{
  type: "notification",
  notification: {
    notificationId: "f7e9ebaf-92f0-43b9-a410-ad8c24f3333b"
    title: "Yoinked!",
    body: "horsefacts captured the flag from you.",
  }
}
```

#### Launcher

Indicates that the Mini App was launched directly by the client app outside of a context, e.g. via some type of catalog or a notification triggered by the client.

```ts
> sdk.context.location
{
  type: "launcher"
}
```

#### Cast Object Structure

When your Mini App is launched from a cast context (either `cast_embed` or `cast_share`), you receive a comprehensive cast object with the following metadata:

- **author**: The user who created the cast, including their FID, username, display name, and profile picture
- **hash**: The unique identifier for the cast
- **parentHash** (optional): If this is a reply, the hash of the parent cast
- **parentFid** (optional): If this is a reply, the FID of the parent cast author
- **timestamp** (optional): Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the cast was created
- **mentions** (optional): Array of users mentioned in the cast
- **embeds** (optional): Array of URLs embedded in the cast
- **channelKey** (optional): The channel where the cast was posted

### `user`

Details about the calling user which can be used to customize the interface. This should be considered untrusted since it is passed in by the application, and there is no guarantee that it was authorized by the user.

```ts
export type AccountLocation = {
  placeId: string;

  /**
   * Human-readable string describing the location
   */
  description: string;
};

export type UserContext = {
  fid: number;
  username?: string;
  displayName?: string;

  /**
   * Profile image URL
   */
  pfpUrl?: string;
  location?: AccountLocation;
};
```

```ts
> sdk.context.user
{
  "fid": 6841,
  "username": "deodad",
  "displayName": "Tony D'Addeo",
  "pfp": "https://i.imgur.com/dMoIan7.jpg",
  "bio": "Building @warpcast and @farcaster, new dad, like making food",
  "location": {
    "placeId": "ChIJLwPMoJm1RIYRetVp1EtGm10",
    "description": "Austin, TX, USA"
  }
}
```

```ts
type User = {
  fid: number;
  username?: string;
  displayName?: string;
  pfp?: string;
  bio?: string;
  location?: {
    placeId: string;
    description: string;
  };
};
```

### client

Details about the Farcaster client running the Mini App. This should be considered untrusted

- `clientFid`: the self-reported FID of the client (e.g. 9152 for Warpcast)
- `added`: whether the user has added the Mini App to the client
- `safeAreaInsets`: insets to avoid areas covered by navigation elements that obscure the view
- `notificationDetails`: in case the user has enabled notifications, includes the `url` and `token` for sending notifications

```ts
export type SafeAreaInsets = {
  top: number;
  bottom: number;
  left: number;
  right: number;
};

export type ClientContext = {
  clientFid: number;
  added: boolean;
  notificationDetails?: FrameNotificationDetails;
  safeAreaInsets?: SafeAreaInsets;
};
```

```ts
> sdk.context.client
{
  clientFid: 9152,
  added: true,
  safeAreaInsets: {
    top: 0,
    bottom: 20,
    left: 0,
    right: 0,
  };
  notificationDetails: {
    url: "https://api.farcaster.xyz/v1/frame-notifications",
    token: "a05059ef2415c67b08ecceb539201cbc6"
  }
}
```

```ts
type FrameNotificationDetails = {
  url: string;
  token: string;
};

type SafeAreaInsets = {
  top: number;
  bottom: number;
  left: number;
  right: number;
};

type ClientContext = {
  clientFid: number;
  added: boolean;
  safeAreaInsets?: SafeAreaInsets;
  notificationDetails?: FrameNotificationDetails;
};
```

#### Using safeAreaInsets

Mobile devices render navigation elements that obscure the view of an app. Use
the `safeAreaInsets` to render content in the safe area that won't be obstructed.

A basic usage would to wrap your view in a container that adds margin:

```
<div style={{
  marginTop: context.client.safeAreaInsets.top,
  marginBottom: context.client.safeAreaInsets.bottom,
  marginLeft: context.client.safeAreaInsets.left,
  marginRight: context.client.safeAreaInsets.right,
}}>
  ...your app view
</div>
```

However, you may want to set these insets on specific elements: for example if
you have tab bar at the bottom of your app with a different background, you'd
want to set the bottom inset as padding there so it looks attached to the
bottom of the view.

**Note:** For more fine-grained capability detection, use the [`getCapabilities()`](/docs/sdk/detecting-capabilities#getcapabilities) method which returns specific SDK methods supported by the host.

Example usage with `getCapabilities()`:

```ts
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/frame-sdk'

// Get list of supported capabilities
const capabilities = await sdk.getCapabilities()

// Check if specific haptic methods are supported
if (capabilities.includes('haptics.impactOccurred')) {
  // Impact haptic feedback is available
  await sdk.haptics.impactOccurred('medium')
}
```
