# requestCameraAndMicrophoneAccess

Request permission to access the device's camera and microphone. This method triggers a permission dialog in the host app.

:::note
This is an experimental feature and may not be available on all platforms. Check the `features.cameraAndMicrophoneAccess` flag in the SDK context to determine if this feature is supported.
:::

## Usage

```ts twoslash
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/miniapp-sdk'

try {
  await sdk.actions.requestCameraAndMicrophoneAccess()
  console.log('Camera and microphone access granted')
  // You can now use camera and microphone in your mini app
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Camera and microphone access denied')
  // Handle the denial gracefully
}
```

## Return Value

Returns a `Promise<void>` that:
- **Resolves** when the user grants permission
- **Rejects** when the user denies permission or dismisses the dialog

## Feature Detection

Before using this action, check if it's supported:

```ts twoslash
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/miniapp-sdk'

// Check if the feature is available
const context = await sdk.context
if (context.features?.cameraAndMicrophoneAccess) {
  // Feature is supported and permissions have been granted
  // You can use camera/microphone features
} else {
  // Feature is not supported or permissions not granted
}
```

## Permissions

- The permission dialog will only be shown once per domain
- If the user has previously granted or denied permissions, the promise will immediately resolve or reject accordingly
- Users can revoke permissions at any time by:
  1. Opening the mini app
  2. Tapping the options menu (three dots)
  3. Toggling the camera and microphone access switch

## Example: Video Recording

```ts twoslash
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/miniapp-sdk'

async function startVideoRecording() {
  try {
    // Request permissions first
    await sdk.actions.requestCameraAndMicrophoneAccess()
    
    // Now you can access getUserMedia
    const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ 
      video: true, 
      audio: true 
    })
    
    // Use the stream for video recording
    const videoElement = document.querySelector('video')
    if (videoElement) {
      videoElement.srcObject = stream
    }
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Error && error.name === 'NotAllowedError') {
      // Permissions were denied
      alert('Camera and microphone access is required for video recording')
    } else {
      console.error('Failed to start recording:', error)
    }
  }
}
```

## Platform Support

| Platform | Supported | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| iOS      | ✅         | Full support with domain-level permissions |
| Android  | ✅         | Supported (see note below) |
| Web      | ❌         | Not currently supported |

:::note
On Android, camera and microphone permissions work slightly differently than iOS. Once permissions are granted to the host app, mini apps may have access without additional prompts. This is standard behavior for Android WebView permissions.
:::

:::warning
Camera and microphone access is not supported in web mini apps. The action will always reject on web platforms.
