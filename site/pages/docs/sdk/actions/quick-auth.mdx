# quickAuth

:::warning
This is an experimental feature.
:::

Request a signed JWT from a [Farcaster Quick Auth
Server](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/discussions/231). This is the
quickest way to protect your endpoints using Sign In with Farcaster.

### Quick Auth vs Sign In with Farcaster

[Sign In with
Farcaster](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/discussions/110) is the
foundational standard that allow Farcaster users to authenticate into
applications.

[Farcaster Quick
Server](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/discussions/231) is an
optional service built on top of SIWF that is highly performant and easy to
integrate.

If you're not sure where to start we recommend using Quick Auth.


## Usage

```ts twoslash
// ---cut---
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/frame-sdk'

const { token } = await sdk.experimental.quickAuth()
```

## Parameters

### quickAuthServerOrigin

- **Type:** `quickAuthServerOrigin`

Use a custom Quick Auth Server. Defaults to `https://auth.farcaster.xyz`.


## Return Value

A [JWT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) issued by the Quick Auth
Server based on the Sign In with Farcaster credential signed by the user.

```ts
type QuickAuthResult = {
  /**
   * JWT issued the Quick Auth Server.
   */
  token: string;
}
```

Store this token in memory (i.e. React state) and include it as an
authorization header to make authenticated requests to your server. 

Your server must verify the token:

```ts
const { createClient } from "@farcaster/quick-auth";

const client = createClient();

// Set this to whatever domain your Mini App is being server from. If you're
// developing locally use the domain you are tunneling from.
const domain = 'example.com';

/**
 * Inside your request handler extract the JWT from a request header
 * and verify it using @farcaster/quick-auth.
 *
 * token - the JWT issued by a Quick Auth Server 
 * domain - the domain the token was issued to, this should be the same domain
 * as your mini app is running on.
 */
const payload = await client.verifyJwt({ token, domain })
```
