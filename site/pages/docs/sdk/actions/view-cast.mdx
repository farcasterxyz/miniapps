# viewCast

Open a specific cast in the Farcaster client. This navigates the user to view
the full cast with its replies and reactions.

## Usage

```ts twoslash
const castHash = "0x1234567890abcdef";

// ---cut---
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/miniapp-sdk'

await sdk.actions.viewCast({ 
  hash: castHash,
})
```

## Parameters

### hash

- **Type:** `string`

The hash of the cast to view. This should be a valid cast hash from the Farcaster protocol.

### close (optional)

- **Type:** `boolean`

Whether the app should be closed when this action is called. If true, the app
will be closed after opening the cast view.

## Return Value

`Promise<void>` - This action does not return a value. It triggers navigation to the cast view in the Farcaster client.

```ts twoslash
import { sdk } from "@farcaster/miniapp-sdk";

// ---cut---
// View a specific cast
await sdk.actions.viewCast({ 
  hash: "0x1234567890abcdef"
})

// View a cast and close the mini app
await sdk.actions.viewCast({ 
  hash: "0x1234567890abcdef",
  close: true
})
```
