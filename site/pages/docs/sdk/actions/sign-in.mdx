Request a [Sign in with Farcaster
(SIWF)](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/developers/siwf/) credential from the user. 

See the guide on [authenticating users](/docs/guides/auth).

![signing in a user](/sign_in_preview.png)

<Caption>
  A user opens an app and is automatically signed in
</Caption>

## Usage

```ts twoslash
/**
 * Cryptographically secure nonce generated on the server and associated with
 * the user's session.
 */ 
const nonce = 'securenonce';

// ---cut---
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/frame-sdk'

await sdk.actions.signIn({ 
  nonce,
  acceptAuthAddress: true
})
```

## Parameters

### nonce

- **Type:** `string`

A random string used to prevent replay attacks, at least 8 alphanumeric
characters.

### acceptAuthAddress

- **Type:** `boolean`

Whether an [Auth
Address](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/discussions/225) signed
message is acceptable. Defaults to `false` to maintain backwards compatibility,
though applications should set this to `true` for the best user experience
assuming their verification method supports it.


## Return Value

The SIWF message and signature.

```ts
type SignInResult = {
  signature: string;
  message: string;
}
```

:::note
This message must be sent to your server and verified. See the guide on
[authenticating with Farcaster](/docs/guides/auth) for more information.
