Prompts the user to add the app.

![adding a mini app in Warpcast](/add_frame_preview.png)

<Caption>
  A user discovers an app from their social feed, adds it, and then sees it
  from their apps screen
</Caption>

## Usage

```ts twoslash
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/miniapp-sdk'

await sdk.actions.addMiniApp()
```

The `addMiniApp()` action requires your app's domain to exactly match the domain in your manifest file. This means:

- You cannot use tunnel domains (ngrok, localtunnel, etc.) - the action will fail
- Your app must be deployed to the same domain specified in your `farcaster.json`
- For local development, use the preview tool instead of trying to add the app

## Return Value

`void`


## Errors

### `RejectedByUser`

Thrown if a user rejects the request to add the Mini App.


### `InvalidDomainManifestJson`

Thrown when an app does not have a valid `farcaster.json` or when the domain doesn't match. Common causes:

- Using a tunnel domain (ngrok, localtunnel) instead of your production domain
- The app's current domain doesn't match the domain in the manifest  
- The manifest file is missing or malformed
