# What's New

## June 9, 2025 (0.0.61)

- Moved Quick Auth out of experimental and enhanced functionality:
	- Use `sdk.quickAuth.getToken()` in place of `sdk.experimental.quickAuth()`.
	`getToken` will store the token in memory and return if it not expired,
	otherwise a new token will be fetched. Developers no longer need to manage
	keeping this token around or checking expiration and can make calls to
	`getToken` whenever needed.
	- Added `fetch` which is a wrapper around the browser Fetch API that
	adds a Quick Auth token as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.
