# Wallet

The SDK exposes an experimental Solana provider at `sdk.experimental.getSolanaProvider()`.
This provider is modeled after `window.phantom.solana` and its full API can be found [here](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/miniapps/blob/main/packages/frame-core/src/solana.ts).

We're working on integrating Wallet Standard to enable developers to use the Solana Wallet Adapter.
