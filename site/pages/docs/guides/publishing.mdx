# Publishing your app

Publishing Mini Apps involves providing information like who developed the app,
how it should be displayed, and what its capabilities are.

Since Farcaster is a decentralized network with multiple clients, publishing is
done by hosting a manifest file at `/.well-known/farcaster.json` on the domain
your app is hosted on rather than submitting information directly to a single
entity.

  Published Mini Apps can be discovered in App Stores.

## Steps

::::steps

### Choose a domain

A Mini App is associated with a single domain (i.e. rewards.warpcast.com). This
domain serves as the identifier for your app and can't be changed later so
you should choose a stable domain. 

There's no limit on the number of apps you can create. You can create a separate 
domain specifically for development purposes if needed.

:::note
A domain does not include the scheme (e.g. https) or path. It can optionally
include a subdomain.
- ‚úÖ rewards.warpcast.com
- ‚ùå https://rewards.warpcast.com
:::


### Host a manifest file

Host a manifest file on your chosen domain at `/.well-known/farcaster.json`.

For now we'll create an empty file:

```sh
touch public/.well-known/farcaster.json
```

#### Farcaster Hosted Manifests (closed beta)

Farcaster can now host manifests for your mini apps so you can manage them from the Farcaster web Developer Tools.

  <summary>Learn more</summary>

Instead of serving a `/.well-known/farcaster.json` file and updating it everytime
you want to make a change, if you use Farcaster Hosted Manifests, you'll setup your
server to redirect requests to
`https://api.farcaster.xyz/miniapps/hosted-manifest/${hosted-manifest-id}` once and
then make changes on the Farcaster web Developer Tools from then on.

:::note
Reach out to [@deodad](https://farcaster.xyz/deodad) or [@gabrielayuso.eth](https://farcaster.xyz/gabrielayuso.eth) if you want to get access to the closed beta.

##### Setting up redirects

All web servers support redirects. The following are examples of how to setup redirects in popular frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Redirects in Next.js</summary>

```ts
// next.config.js
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
 
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/.well-known/farcaster.json',
        destination: 'https://api.farcaster.xyz/miniapps/hosted-manifest/1234567890',
        permanent: false,
      },
    ]
  },
}
 
export default nextConfig
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Redirects in Express</summary>

```ts
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.get('/.well-known/farcaster.json', (req, res) => {
  res.redirect(307, 'https://api.farcaster.xyz/miniapps/hosted-manifest/1234567890')
})
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Redirects in Hono</summary>

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'
const app = new Hono()

app.get('/.well-known/farcaster.json', (c) => {
  return c.redirect('https://api.farcaster.xyz/miniapps/hosted-manifest/1234567890', 307)
})

```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Redirects in Remix</summary>

```ts
// app/routes/.well-known/farcaster.json.tsx
import { redirect } from '@remix-run/node'

export const loader = () => {
  return redirect('https://api.farcaster.xyz/miniapps/hosted-manifest/1234567890', 307)
}

export default () => null
```
</details>

</details>




### Define your application configuration

A Mini App has metadata that is used by Farcaster clients to host your app. This
data is specified in the `frame` property of the manifest and has the following properties:

import ManifestAppConfigSchema from "../../../snippets/manifestAppConfigSchema.mdx"

<ManifestAppConfigSchema />

Here's an example `farcaster.json` file:

```json
{
  "frame": {
    "version": "1",
    "name": "Yoink!",
    "iconUrl": "https://yoink.party/logo.png",
    "homeUrl": "https://yoink.party/framesV2/",
    "imageUrl": "https://yoink.party/framesV2/opengraph-image",
    "buttonTitle": "üö© Start",
    "splashImageUrl": "https://yoink.party/logo.png",
    "splashBackgroundColor": "#f5f0ec",
    "requiredChains": [
      "eip155:8453"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": [
      "actions.signIn",
      "wallet.getEthereumProvider",
      "actions.swapToken"
    ]
  }
}
```

:::note
You can omit `webhookUrl` for now. We'll show you how to set it up in the
[sending notifications guide](/docs/guides/notifications).

### Hybrid & SSR-friendly detection <span id="hybrid-detection"/>

Some apps serve **both** as a Farcaster Mini App and a website from the same
domain.  When you want to fetch specific resources **during server-side rendering (SSR)** or
conditionally lazy-load the SDK on the client, add a lightweight flag that only
Mini-App launch URLs include

**Two suggested patterns**

| Pattern | How it looks | Why use it |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **Dedicated path** | `/your/path/.../miniapp` | Easiest to match on the server |
| **Well-known query param** | `https://example.com/page?miniApp=true` | Works when a single page serves both modes |

:::note
Treat these markers as a **best-effort hint, not proof**.  
Anyone can append the path or query flag, so use it only as a handy heuristic
for *lazy-loading the SDK* or *branching SSR logic*‚Äînever as a security-grade
guarantee that you‚Äôre inside a Farcaster Mini App.
:::

#### Example

```ts
// app/layout.tsx
'use client'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const url = new URL(window.location.href)
    const isMini =
      url.pathname.startsWith('/mini') ||
      url.searchParams.get('miniApp') === 'true'

    if (isMini) {
      import('@farcaster/frame-sdk').then(({ sdk }) => {
        // Mini-App‚Äìspecific bootstrap here
        // e.g. sdk.actions.ready()
      })
    }
  }, [])

  return children
}
```

On the server you can do the same check to skip expensive Mini App work during
SSR.

## Verifying ownership

A Mini App is owned by a single Farcaster account. This lets users know who
they are interacting with and developers get credit for their work.

:::tip
Verified Mini Apps are automatically eligible for [Warpcast Developer
Rewards](https://farcaster.xyz/~/mini-apps/rewards) that are paid out weekly
based on usage and onchain transactions.
:::

![verified author ](/verified_author.png)

Verification is done by placing a cryptographically signed message in the
`accountAssociation` property of your `farcaster.json`. 

You can generate a signed account association object using the [Mini App
Manifest Tool](https://farcaster.xyz/~/developers/new) in Warpcast. Take
the output from that tool and update your `farcaster.json` file.

:::warning
The domain you host the file on must exactly match the domain you entered in
the Warpcast tool.
:::

Here's an example `farcaster.json` file for the domain `yoink.party` with the
account association:

```json
{
  "accountAssociation": {
    "header": "eyJmaWQiOjkxNTIsInR5cGUiOiJjdXN0b2R5Iiwia2V5IjoiMHgwMmVmNzkwRGQ3OTkzQTM1ZkQ4NDdDMDUzRURkQUU5NDBEMDU1NTk2In0",
