# Interacting with Solana wallets

Mini Apps can interact with a user's Solana wallet without needing to worry
about popping open "select your wallet" dialogs or flakey connections.

## Getting Started

The SDK exposes an experimental Solana provider at `sdk.experimental.getSolanaProvider()`.
This provider is modeled after `window.phantom.solana` and its full API can be found [here](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/miniapps/blob/main/packages/frame-core/src/solana.ts).

We're working on integrating Wallet Standard to enable developers to use the Solana Wallet Adapter.

## Demo app

To see how a working Mini App uses the experimental Solana provider, check out our demo Mini App [here](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/frames-v2-demo/blob/main/src/components/Demo.tsx).

## Capabilities check

Note that for future-proofing, the [capability](/docs/sdk/detecting-capabilities) for the Solana provider is defined as `wallet.getSolanaProvider` instead of `experimental.getSolanaProvider`.

## Troubleshooting

### Transaction Scanning

Modern crypto wallets scan transactions and preview them to users to help
protect users from scams. New contracts and applications can generate false
positives in these systems. If your transaction is being reported as
potentially malicious use this [Blockaid
Tool](https://report.blockaid.io/verifiedProject) to verify your app with
Blockaid.
