Mini Apps can seamlessly authenticate Farcaster users to create secure sessions.

## Quick Auth

The easiest way to get an authenticated session for a user. [Quick
Auth](/docs/sdk/quick-auth) uses [Sign in with
Farcaster](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/developers/siwf/) under the hood to
authenticate the user and returns a standard JWT that can be easily verified by
your server and used as a session token.

## Sign In with Farcaster

Alternatively, an app can use the [signIn](/docs/sdk/actions/sign-in) to get a
[Sign in with Farcaster](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/developers/siwf/)
authentication credential for the user.

After requesting the credential, applications must verify it on their server
using
[verifySignInMessage](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/auth-kit/client/app/verify-sign-in-message).
Apps can then issue a session token like a JWT that can be used for the
remainder of the session. 


## Enable seamless sign in on web

Farcaster recently added support for signing in via additional wallets (see the
[Auth Address](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/discussions/225)
standard).

If you are using Quick Auth no action is needed. If you are using `signIn`
directly you will need to make a couple changes to support signing in with Auth
Addresses:

::::steps

### Accept auth addresses

Update `@farcaster/frame-sdk` to version `0.0.39` or later. Opt in to auth
address sign in by passing `acceptAuthAddress: true` to the `signIn` action:

```ts
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/frame-sdk'
 
await sdk.actions.signIn({ 
  nonce,
  acceptAuthAddress: true
});
```

::::


Farcaster client developers can find more information [here](https://www.notion.so/warpcast/Public-Auth-Address-Implementation-Guide-1fc6a6c0c10180a9b2a7f24c71143eae).


### Verifying an auth address sign in

If you use a third party authentication provider like Privy or Dynamic, check
their docs. Youâ€™ll likely need to update your dependencies.

If you verify sign in messages yourself, update the `@farcaster/auth-client`
package to version `0.7.0` or later. Call `verifySignInMessage` will now verify
signatures from a custody or auth address.
