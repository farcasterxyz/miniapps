### Using localhost

If you are using localhost you'll need to make your local server publicly
accessible using a tool like ngrok or cloudflared so that Warpcast can scrape
embed information from your sever.

We recommend using cloudflared since it's free and quick to setup.

::::steps

#### Install cloudflared

```sh
brew install cloudflared
```

For more installation options see the [official docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/).


#### Expose localhost

Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8080
```

Be sure to specify the correct port for your local server.


#### Use the provided url

`cloudflared` will generate a random subdomain and print it in the terminal for
you to use. Any traffic to this URL will get sent to you local server.

Enter the provided URL in the Warpcast developer tool.

### First-time tunnel setup

When using a tunnel URL for the first time, you must open it in your browser before using it in the preview tool. This is a security measure that prevents unauthorized access to local development servers.

1. Open the tunnel URL directly in your browser
2. You should see your local application
3. Now the URL can be used in the Mini App preview tool or embed debugger
