# GREMLIN: Living Social Organism for Farcaster

GREMLIN is a revolutionary miniapp that brings digital creatures to life within the Farcaster social network. These creatures evolve in real-time based on your social activity, creating a living ecosystem of interconnected organisms.

## Features

### 🧬 Real-Time Evolution
- Creatures mutate based on social behavior patterns
- Activity tracking for posts, engagement, conflicts, and network interactions
- Visual mutations that reflect your digital persona

### 🌐 Network Effects
- Mutations can spread between users through network interactions
- Trait inheritance with random evolution during transfer
- Living ecosystem with traceable lineage trees

### 🎨 Bio-Digital Aesthetic
- Dark, atmospheric interface with bioluminescent accents
- WebGL-powered creature visualization
- Terminal/laboratory aesthetic with organic chaos

### 📊 Social Bio-Metrics
- **Engagement (Food)**: Influences creature energy and growth
- **Conflict (Stress)**: Affects aggression and defensive mutations
- **Frequency (Heartbeat)**: Determines activity levels and rhythm

### 🧪 Scientific Interface
- Real-time vital signs and creature status
- Mutation tracking and lineage visualization
- Network statistics and gene pool monitoring

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, CSS3
- **Graphics**: WebGL-powered creature engine with particle systems
- **Integration**: Farcaster Frame SDK compatibility
- **Design**: Bio-digital brutalism aesthetic with custom CSS system

## Creature Mutations

### Common Mutations
- **Shadow Flake**: Emerges from network silence
- **Heartbeat Sync**: Rhythmic adaptation to social patterns
- **Night Owl**: Dark hours activity adaptation

### Rare Mutations
- **Ink Aura**: Dark matter absorption ability
- **Debate Teeth**: Sharpened from heated arguments
- **Social Butterfly**: Network connection enhancement

### Epic/Legendary Mutations
- **Gene Weaver**: Advanced mutation inheritance
- **Thick Skin**: Resilience from criticism
- **Viral Surge**: Content adaptation from high engagement

### Mythic Mutations
- **Phoenix Spark**: Born from complete network death
- **Void Touch**: Touched by digital emptiness

## How It Works

1. **Activity Tracking**: Monitor user activity on Farcaster
2. **Behavior Analysis**: Analyze patterns in engagement, conflict, and frequency
3. **Mutation Triggers**: Check for conditions that trigger mutations
4. **Visual Evolution**: Update creature appearance and behavior
5. **Network Sharing**: Share mutations with the broader ecosystem
6. **Lineage Tracking**: Maintain evolutionary history and genealogy

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. For Farcaster integration, deploy to a web server and configure Frame SDK

## Usage

- **Interact with Creature**: Click on the creature to see reaction effects
- **Share Mutations**: Use the action buttons to share with network
- **View Lineage**: Track evolutionary history and family tree
- **Export Data**: Save creature DNA and mutation data

## Network Integration

The app simulates Farcaster integration with:
- User activity tracking
- Network mutation events
- Trait inheritance between users
- Real-time ecosystem statistics

## Design Philosophy

GREMLIN represents the first "living" social organism in a digital network. Instead of static features or games, it creates emergent narrative and cultural identity through:
- **Behavioral Reflection**: Creatures mirror user personality and activity
- **Network Evolution**: Mutations spread and evolve through social connections
- **Living History**: Every interaction becomes part of the creature's DNA
- **Cultural Significance**: Creatures become unique digital artifacts

## Future Enhancements

- Direct Farcaster API integration
- Real-time multiplayer creature interactions
- Advanced genetic algorithms for mutation evolution
- AR/VR visualization modes
- Mobile app companion
